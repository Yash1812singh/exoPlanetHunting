# exoPlanetHunting
 created a model that can predict the existence of an Exoplanet, utilizing the flux (light intensity) readings from 3198 different stars over time. For this dataset investigation I used Python along with these libraries: Pandas, Jupyter notebook, SKLearn, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib and Seaborn
the project is a new approach to the quest for exoplanets in which a large network of astronomers located in the five continents have the time to continuously observe each star individually during long periods of time in the search for dips in brightness produced by transiting exoplanets
